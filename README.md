# <horiseon-refactor>

## Description

This project aimed to conduct a refactor of the Horiseon homepage. The initial site lacked accessible alt attributes and a website title limiting SEO. It also had a broken link in the navigation header. The html file had numerous non descriptive elements with associated class headers while the css had repeated styles for multiple class selectors. While these resulted in a mostly functional webpage, the underlying code was messy and hard to parse.

Thus, the goal of this project was to add accessible alt attributes to the images, fix broken site functionality, and clean up the underlying code to make it more readable.

This project highlighted the use of semantic elements in html and associated element selectors in css. It also highlighted using element selectors to condense code by applying styles to multiple parts of the page rather then creating classes or ids for every element.
